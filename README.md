# Simulation-of-Graphene
 Modeling the system of atoms of copper, graphene and hydrogen. The system consists of a crystal lattice of copper, one layer of an ideal hexagonal graphene grille and hydrogen atoms, randomly distributed at the same height.
 
 Content:
 
 - C++ code which generates coordinates of the graphene crystal lattice and hydrogen atoms
 - Lammps file for simulating the interaction between hydrogen, carbon and graphene atoms
 - SiC file with constants needed for Lammps functions
 - Input parameters file
